when you create a new branch, e.g. "David", at this point, all files in the default branch (which is "master" branch) will clone to the David branch 
and any changes after that, will only inside the David branch.
e.g
	create David branch by using github desktop
	when you go to file storage location, seems nothing changed, but indeed, all file in your computer now is "belongs" to David branch
	addd a file
